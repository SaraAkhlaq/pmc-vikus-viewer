# Pual Mellon Centre 

The [Paul Mellon Centre](https://www.paul-mellon-centre.ac.uk/) is an educational charity that champions new ways of understanding British art history and culture. We publish, teach and carry out research, both at the Centre in London and through our online platforms. Our archives, library and lively events programme are open to researchers, students and the public. The Centreâ€™s grants and fellowships programme supports institutions and individuals with research projects, publications, exhibitions and events. Through all areas of our work, we promote activities that enhance and expand knowledge about British art and architecture. The Centre was founded in 1970 by the art collector and philanthropist Paul Mellon. It is part of Yale University and a partner to the Yale Center for British Art.
